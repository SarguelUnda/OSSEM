# http

Event fields used to define/normalize metadata about HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) information. This is based on information in the layer 7 (HTTP) application, however can also include HTTP information from an endpoint/server. IIS, Apache, NGINX, proxy logs, and other variances of logs that have HTTP information would go in here. Also, if the HTTP connection is from a decrypted/MITM HTTPS/TLS session then portions of that information, where applicable, would go in here.
