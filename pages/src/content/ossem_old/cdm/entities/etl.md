# etl

Event fields used to define/normalize specific metadata about the event during the processing of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline.

## Attributes

| Name | Type | Description | Sample Value |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
 | etl_format_applied | string | Formatting or encoding applied during the ETL processing. Also referred to as CODEC in some use cases. Can be an array if multiple formats were applied/determined | ```[ "sylog", "json" ]``` |
 | etl_format_is_cef | boolean | During ETL processing, event is determined to be CEF (format) | ```false``` |
 | etl_format_is_json | boolean | During ETL processing, event is determined to be JSON (format) | ```true``` |
 | etl_format_is_syslog | boolean | During ETL processing, event is determined to be Syslog (format). Technically you could send data encoded in different format over syslog (ie: CEF or JSON), therefore an event/log can have this tag/field as well as other format fields | ```true``` |
 | etl_format_is_xml | boolean | During ETL processing, event is determined to be XML (format) | ```true``` |
 | etl_host_agent_type | string | Type of forwarder from the client (i.e. winlogbeat, nxlog, rsyslog, etc) | ```nxlog``` |
 | etl_host_agent_uid | string | UID for the host's software/agent a part of the event | ```fe4fb818-088f-4529-a343-b94baf057a53``` |
 | etl_info_tags | string | Use for any additional information about an event/log during ETL/processing pipeline. Commonly, you would use this for things that are rare but happen (i.e. parsing error for non conforming RFC). Use this field to alert or give context to a user/analyst when looking at the data. | ```inferred network_protocol as udp``` |
 | etl_input_application_name | string | Application name used to receive or gather the log for the very first portion of the ETL processing (i.e. kafka, beats, syslog) | ```kafka``` |
 | etl_input_application_protocol | string | Application protocol used to receive or gather the log for the very first portion of the ETL processing (ex: syslog, http, sftp) | ```kafka``` |
 | etl_input_port | integer | Port (network) used to receive or gather the log for the very first portion of the ETL processing | ```9092``` |
 | etl_input_protocol | string | Protocol (network) used to receive or gather the log for the very first portion of the ETL processing (ie: tcp, udp, icmp) | ```tcp``` |
 | etl_input_src_port | integer | The Port (network) the client/source used to send the log for the very first portion of the ETL processing. Mostly used in syslog | ```48231``` |
 | etl_kafka_consumer_group | string | Consumer group that the etl was apart of from consuming from a Kafka topic | ```helk_logstash``` |
 | etl_kafka_key | string | Record key, if any | `````` |
 | etl_kafka_offset | long | Kafka partition for the event | ```204802842``` |
 | etl_kafka_partition | integer | Kafka partition for the event | ```1``` |
 | etl_kafka_time | date | Depending on your Kafka broker configuration, this can be either when the record was created (default) or when it was received by the broker | ```4/11/2018 5:49:25``` |
 | etl_kafka_topic | string | Kafka topic name | ```winevent``` |
 | etl_pipeline | string | Used to keep track of tags related to transforms, enrichment, or modifications made in an ETL pipeline | ```all-add_processed_timestamp``` |
 | etl_processed_time | date | The first time the event gets processed by the ETL (processing pipeline) | ```4/11/2018 5:49:25``` |
 | etl_version | string | The schema or transform versioning that is being applied | ```v1.0.1``` |
